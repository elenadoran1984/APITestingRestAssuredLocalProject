The project is created based on https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-automated-api-testing-with-rest-assured course, by Angie Jones.

In this course, I have learned:
How to use REST Assured to make various types of API requests in Java, with and without additional data, and how to verify the response received from the API.
How to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
How you can serialize data to send as part of the request.
How you can validate API responses and deserialize data received from the response.

Setup Environment: 
Java SE 17+
IntelliJ
Rest Assured
Junit Jupiter API
Jackson Databind
Permissions on you machine
Have your own local instance of API
Configure localhost: download (www.mamp.info) and install MAMP which will allow you to use your computer as the hosting server for your copy of the API
